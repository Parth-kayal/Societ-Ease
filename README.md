# Society Management System

The Society Management System is a software application designed to simplify the management of a society. The system provides a user-friendly interface that allows the society members to manage their activities, communicate with each other, and keep track of their financial transactions. This document provides a detailed description of the system, including its requirements, design, and implementation.

## SRS Document

The SRS document outlines the requirements of the Society Management System. It includes a detailed description of the system's features, functionalities, and constraints. The SRS document serves as a reference for the developers and stakeholders throughout the development process.

## DFD

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the system's data flow. It shows how data moves through the system, from input to output. The DFD is an essential tool for understanding the system's data flow and identifying potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

## High-Level Design

The High-Level Design provides an overview of the system's architecture and functionality. It outlines the system's modules, components, and their interactions. The High-Level Design serves as a blueprint for the system's development and implementation.

## Low-Level Design

The Low-Level Design provides a detailed description of the system's modules and components. It includes information on the system's data structures, algorithms, and interfaces. The Low-Level Design serves as a reference for the developers during the implementation phase.

## Activity Diagram

The Activity Diagram is a graphical representation of the system's activities and their flow. It shows how the system's activities are executed and how they interact with each other. The Activity Diagram is an essential tool for understanding the system's behavior and identifying potential issues.

## Collaboration Diagram

The Collaboration Diagram is a graphical representation of the system's objects and their interactions. It shows how the system's objects collaborate with each other to achieve the system's goals. The Collaboration Diagram is an essential tool for understanding the system's object-oriented design and identifying potential issues.

## Use Case Diagram

The Use Case Diagram is a graphical representation of the system's use cases and their relationships. It shows how the system's actors interact with the system to achieve their goals. The Use Case Diagram is an essential tool for understanding the system's requirements and identifying potential issues.

## Decision Tree Table

The Decision Tree Table is a tabular representation of the system's decision-making process. It shows how the system's decisions are made based on the system's inputs and conditions. The Decision Tree Table is an essential tool for understanding the system's decision-making process and identifying potential issues.

## Final Project

The Final Project is the fully implemented and tested version of the Society Management System. It includes all the system's features, functionalities, and interfaces. The Final Project is the end result of the development process and is ready for deployment.
